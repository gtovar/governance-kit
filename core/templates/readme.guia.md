# Official README Writing Guide

This guide defines the minimum structure and best practices for creating consistent `README.md` files across projects.

Inspired by:

- **Readme-Driven Development** — Tom Preston-Werner
- **GitHub Open Source Guides**
- **Google Engineering Practices**
- **Clean Architecture / The Art of Readable Code**

---

## Purpose of a README

1. **Onboarding in ≤ 2 minutes:** any developer must understand and run the project locally.
2. **Single source of truth:** the README is the entry point; avoid duplicating critical info elsewhere.
3. **Implicit contract:** it defines expectations before writing code.

## Required Structure

| Section                          | Description                                    | Purpose                         |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Title**                        | Concise, descriptive project name.             | Immediate identification.       |
| **Description / Purpose**        | One-sentence summary of the problem it solves. | "Start with why."               |
| **Technical Requirements**       | Language, DB, and service versions.            | Prevent environment mismatches. |
| **Installation & Configuration** | Steps to clone, install, and set up `.env`.    | Accelerate onboarding.          |
| **Basic Usage**                  | Minimal run or API example.                    | Quick verification.             |
| **Extended Docs**                | Links to `/docs/*.md` or Swagger.              | Keep the README lightweight.    |
| **Contribution**                 | PR, branch, and commit rules.                  | Maintain team consistency.      |
| **License**                      | License type or privacy notice.                | Legal compliance.               |

> Rule of thumb: if a section exceeds 4 lines, move it to `/docs/` and link it.
